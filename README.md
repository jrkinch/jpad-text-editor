> [!TIP]
> Ran into an issue where .jar file wouldn't run or do anything.<br>
> These are the steps I took to fix the issue:<br>
> 1) The jarfix program still wouldn't run the .jar file but now got 'a java exception has occurred' error.<br>
> 2) Used the uninstall tool as I had multiple versions of Java.<br>
> 3) Reinstalled latest version but still getting same 'a java exception has occurred' error.<br>
> 4) Restarted computer and now able to use .jar file to run program.<br>
